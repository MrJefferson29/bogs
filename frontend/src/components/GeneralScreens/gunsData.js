    description: `Umarex Ruger Mark IV Spring Air Pistol in Stainless is a genuine replica of Ruger's .22 LR pistol of the same name. The high-quality metal system is adorned with the original markings and, together with the fiber optic front sight, gives it the authentic look that fans of the iconic rimfire pistol appreciate so much.
Instead of a 10-round magazine, the spring-operated version relies on a classic single-shot break-barrel system. The textured polymer barrel sleeve ensures easy cocking, while the automatic safety locks the trigger. In terms of precision, the rifled barrel in combination with the height- and side-adjustable rear sight leaves nothing to be desired.
